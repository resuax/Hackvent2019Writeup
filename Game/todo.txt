[TODO after v1.0]
-PlayPanel.java paintComponent
     -Put getHeight/world.rows and getWidth/world.columns calculations in
     constructor for GameObject as they are always the same to do the alignment
     -Eventually create an ArrayList of GameObjects that stores all the objects
     of the game (Enemies, Explosions, Bullets, etc..) and is used in a for loop
     to draw all of these stored objects using the 4 alignment methods of
     GameObject, which will elimiate all of the repeated code used to draw the
     various objects of the game
-Make it so that doing rm *.class and javac *.java works without producing a
bunch of errors
-Fix bug: can go to main menu and "Get Question" and answer incorrectly several
times and get game over screen when not actually playing the game
-what are the differences between instructions.txt and howToPlay.txt?
      -get rid of instructions.txt
-CorrectAnswerPanel and IncorrectAnswerPanel are almost exactly the same
      -Creat GameObject like class?
