The Immune System is the body's natural defense against microscopic invaders. It attacks organisms such as bacteria, microbes, viruses, toxins and parasites that would love to spread disease and illness. The Immune System is vital in keeping you happy and healthy.
The Immune System is made up of a network of cells, tissues, and organs that work together to protect the body. The cells involved are white blood cells, or leukocytes, which come in two basic types that combine to seek out and destroy disease-causing organisms or substances.
