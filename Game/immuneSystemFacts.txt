The Immune System is the body's natural defense against microscopic invaders. It attacks organisms such as bacteria, microbes, viruses, toxins and parasites that would love to spread disease and illness. The Immune System is vital in keeping you happy and healthy.
The Immune System is made up of a network of cells, tissues, and organs that work together to protect the body. The cells involved are white blood cells, or leukocytes, which come in two basic types that combine to seek out and destroy disease-causing organisms or substances.
Leukocytes are produced or stored in many locations in the body, including the thymus, spleen, and bone marrow. For this reason, they're called the lymphoid organs. There are also clumps of lymphoid tissue throughout the body, primarily as lymph nodes, that house the leukocytes.
The leukocytes circulate through the body between the organs and nodes via lymphatic vessels and blood vessels. In this way, the immune system works in a coordinated manner to monitor the body for germs or substances that might cause problems.
Although each type of lymphocyte fights infection differently, the goal of protecting the body from infection remains the same. B cells produce specific antibodies to infectious microorganisms, while T cells kill infectious microorganisms by killing the body cells that are affected.
Antibiotics can be used to treat bacterial infections. However, antibiotics are ineffective in treating illnesses caused by viruses. In addition, antibiotics treat specific bacteria. Overuse or misuse of antibiotics can lead to drug-resistant bacteria. It is important that antibiotics are taken properly and for the duration of the prescription. If antibiotics are stopped early, the bacteria may develop a resistance to the antibiotics and the infection may reoccur.
