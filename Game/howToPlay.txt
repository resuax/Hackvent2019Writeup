In this game, you will control a white blood cell. Your goal is to travel around the human body while fighting off attacks from enemy germs. If you allow a germ to hit you or get past you, you will be asked a question regarding the Immune System. Hopefully by the end of your time with this game, you will learn and appreciate how the body defends itself from microscopic danger!
Your cell looks like this:
To move your cell, you will be utilizing the keys on your keyboard. To move RIGHT, use the 'D' key. To move LEFT, use the 'A' key. To shoot bullets at enemies, use the 'SPACEBAR' key. Tapping the SPACEBAR multiple times will generate multiple bullets.
When you are asked a question, you will have an unlimited amount of time to answer it. You will only have one chance to answer the questions, so be careful! You will be prompted with a question every time you allow an enemy to pass you or get hit an enemy. Getting ten mistakes ends the game. Remember, your objective is to protect the body from any harm. Someone is relying on you, so don't let them down. Good luck!
